	<br><br>
	<h2 align="center"><strong>1 . Eligibility</strong></h2>
	<p align="center"><b>Any individual who submits a fully complete application form for membership with a) address proof of residence / work b) mobile <br> phone number & proof of billing address and c) communicable email address is welcome to sign up with JustBooks Solutions <br> Private Limited for the Company’s Library named JustBooks. However, JustBooks reserves the right to accept or reject<br> membership at its sole discretion. Membership is for personal use only. However, it can be transferred to any other individual’s<br>name with explicit communication to JustBooks. No member may re-lend books borrowed from JustBooks at any time. Doing so<br> will entail automatic cancellation of membership.</b></p>
	<br><br>
	<h2 align="center"><strong>2 . Plans & Payment terms</strong></h2>
	<p align ="center"><b>By subscribing to a specific membership plan of JustBooks, the member is explicitly agreeing to pay, in advance, the reading fee<br> attached to the plan plus and any other applicable fee or tax at the frequency specified by the plan. Any non compliance with the<br> payment terms in spite of 2 reminders will attract a penalty of 10% per payment period of the amount due and may lead to<br> cancellation of membership.</b></p>
	<br><br>
	<h2 align="center"><strong>3 . Reading period and reading fee</strong></h2>
	<p align="center"><b>JustBooks proposes a reasonable reading period with a restriction on the number of books that a member can hold at any point<br> in time. No penalty will be levied for delayed return of books. However, under specific circumstances where other library members<br> have requested for and are waiting for a book/s for more than 10 days, JustBooks reserves the right to contact and <br>request members holding book/s to be returned. Members are requested to then return the requested book/s within five (5) days<br> of such request. Reading fees should be paid as per the plan. In the event a member does not renew his/her subscription the<br> company reserves the right to adjust the deposit amount towards the reading fees. If there is no balance in the Deposit Amount,<br> then the company will terminate the membership of the member. All correspondence in this regard will be communicated to the<br> email address of the member as submitted in the application form. Members are requested to update their contact details<br> periodically when changed. Reading fee paid in advance will not be refunded.</b></p>
	<br><br>
	<h2 align="center"><strong>4 . Lost or Damaged books</strong></h2>

	<p align="center"><b>At JustBooks, we take utmost care to maintain books in good condition. Any anomaly (unprinted pages) of damage if found<br> should be reported either at the front desk while getting the book issued or to the delivery executive if the book is delivered at<br> the door. Failure to check and/or report the same will be constituted as if the member has received a book in good condition.<br> While returning the book, The front desk executive or the deliver executive (if the book is collected at the door) will check for any <br>damage of book(s) and report to the member accordingly. The determination of a book being “damaged” will be at the sole<br> discretion of JustBooks. Members can choose to replace a lost or damaged book within 10 days or pay the penalty amount<br> determined by Just Books. The damage policy is detailed below.</b></p>
     <br><br>
	<h2 align="center"><strong>5 . Membership closure & refund of deposit</strong></h2>
	
	<p align="center"><b>To discourage ad-hoc and short term membership, members are required to comply with a minimum membership term of three<br> months. For members who subscribe to plans with a refundable deposit, any premature closure of membership in less than three<br> months from the date of sign-up, will result in the reading fee for the remaining period of the mandatory term getting adjusted <br>against the deposit. The rest of the deposit, however will be refunded. For members who subscribe to annual plans without<br> deposit there is no refund applicable at the time of closure. Under extreme situations caused by non-compliance to the Terms of Use<br> by member, JustBooks clc reserves the right to terminate a membership for any or no reason without any refund.</b></p>
		<br><br>
	<h2 align="center"><strong>6 . Unclaimed Refundable Deposit</strong></h2>
	
	<p align="center"><b>Upon expiry of membership, JustBooks sends reminders over emails/sms to its members for renewal. Three months after expiry,<br> JustBooks reserves the right to classify the account as ‘Dormant’ and initiate steps to recover cost of books and any unpaid<br> reading fee from the refundable deposit, if there is no action on the reminders, which would be communicated to the member<br> through email/sms. Post this recovery, any excess deposit left in the account will be retained as “Unclaimed” refundable deposit<br> for a period of 3 months and periodic reminders would be sent to the member to claim the same. After 12 months of expiry of<br> membership, JustBooks reserves the right to treat the member as “not reachable” and take appropriate action on the unclaimed<br> refundable deposit if there has been no response from the member on the reminder communications.</b></p>
		<br><br>
	<h2 align="center"><strong>7 . Definition of a BOOK</strong></h2>
	
	<p align="center"><b>Since the reading fee is a flat rate and is not linked to the number of books read in a period, it is important to note that each title<br> catalogued in JustBooks gets the same treatments irrespective of size, cost & target reader. Children’s books are treated the<br> same way as other books.</b></p>
		<br><br>
	<h2 align="center"><strong>8 . Membership Card</strong></h2>
	
	<p align="center"><b>Each member of JustBooks will get a RFID based membership card. No transaction at the library will be allowed without this<br> card. Reporting a loss of card or rending a card unfit for use through willful/intentional or unintentional means will<br> attract a replacement cost of Rs.100/- per card<br>. Multiple cards for the same number can be obtained by paying an amount for Rs.100/- per extra card.</b></p>
		<br><br>
	<h2 align="center"><strong>9 . Temporary suspension of membership</strong></h2>
	<p align="center"><b>Through a feature called “Subscription Holiday”, JustBooks allows the member to pause the membership (temporary suspension),<br> for a duration of 1 month, 2 months or 3 months before expiration of membership. During Subscription Holiday period, a member<br> will not be able to use the library. To utilise this feature, a member is required to fill up the Subscription Holiday Form either at<br> the branch or online. All issued books and magazines should be returned to the JustBooks branch before the start<br> date of Subscription Holiday. Members who pay for Yearly and Half-yearly terms will receive free Subscription Holidays of 2 months <br>and 1 month respectively, and are required to pay Rs. 50/- per month there after. Quarterly members are required to pay Rs. 50/- per <br>month to avail the feature.</b></p>
		<br><br>
	<h2 align="center"><strong>10 . Changes to Terms of Use</strong></h2>
	
	<p align="center"><b>JustBooks reserves the right, from time to time, with or without notice, to change these Terms of Use in its sole and absolute<br> discretion. The most current version of these Terms of Use can be reviewed by clicking on the “Terms of Use” located at the<br> bottom of the pages of the JustBooks.in website.
